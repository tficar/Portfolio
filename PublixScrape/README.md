## Description
Those fortunate enough to live in the southeast US know the greatness that is Publix. For those who do not, I pity you. Publix is a highly praised grocery store full of happiness and good experiences. One of their staples is their buy one get one free (BOGO) weekly deals. Every week, from Thursday through Wednesday, they have anywhere from 50-100 products that are BOGO. Usually included in this is at least 1 red wine. This project is meant to find that red wine that's on sale and send an email notifying me. I have also included a couple of my favorite products that are occasionally BOGO.

## Output
The output for this project is an email that contains the specified deals. Publix deals change on Thursday morning, so I have a Windows task that runs every Thursday to find the new deals. Here is a sample of the output.
