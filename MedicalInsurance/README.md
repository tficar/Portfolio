## Description
Similar to the HotelBookings project, this project is a walkthrough of an analysis of a Kaggle data set. I give a background on the data and where it comes from, pose some questions/goals to explore, then explore them.

## Output
There is no specific output to save for this project.

## Setup/How to Run
Make sure to have all of the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. Once these are installed you should be able to run all of the code and work through the notebook.
