## Welcome to my Portfolio!

My goal with this portfolio is to simply provide examples of some of the skills that I have and how I am using them to solve problems and answer questions. These projects span back to 2018 and are just a handful of the personal projects that I have done. I am constantly working on developing my skills in all aspects of data science and reading/learning about the latest techniques and applications.

I plan to continue to add to this portfolio throughout my career as I take on different projects. I also have a website where I will be keeping up with all of my career and personal developments. I am deciding on a domain name still, so once I have that I will post it here.

Take a look around and feel free to reach out to me with any questions!
