## Description
This project was the capstone project for the Data Science Specialization offered on Coursera by Johns Hopkins University. The goal of the project was to create a text prediction algorithm (similar to the one that Apple uses on their iPhones) from scratch using a large number of blog posts, tweets, and news articles. The algorithm would then be hosted on a public server through shiny.

You may notice that the code is more disorganized than usual. This project was one of the first data science projects that I completed, so my coding organization was not the same.

Below is a snippet of the shiny app that was built. It is a very bare bones version of an app, and I am in the process of beefing it up. You can visit it [here](https://tficar.shinyapps.io/CourseraTextPrediction/).

## Output
As mentioned above, the main output for this project is the shiny app. We were also required to create a presentation using R, so I have included that as well.

## Setup/How to Run
Make sure that all required packages are installed. The raw data would be needed in order to recreate the algorithm, however github does not accept files larger than 100MB.
